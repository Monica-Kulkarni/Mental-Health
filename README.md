This project came from a very sad phase of my life, wherein everything was seeming to fall apart. 
I then learnt the importance of stable mental health and the impact it couldâ€™ve on all parts of life. 
Here, I made a Tableau dashboard of a small survey of mental health taken at a workplace. 
I realized how necessary and relieving it was to have someone to listen to your worries and help you stabilize your shaken spirit. 
It also reinstated the core value of being an empathetic listener.
